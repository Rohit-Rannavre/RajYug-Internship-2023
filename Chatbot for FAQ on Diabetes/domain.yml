  utter_intro:
  - text: "Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your 
          body turns food into energy. This happens because your 
          body may not make enough insulin, a hormone the body 
          makes to lower blood sugar, or it cannot use its insulin 
          correctly. There are three main types: type 1, type 2 and 
          gestational diabetes (occurs during pregnancy)."

  utter_types:
  - text: "There are 3 types of diabetes, type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. 
          1) Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an 
          autoimmune reaction. This reaction stops your body from 
          making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who 
          have diabetes have type 1.
          2) With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't use insulin well 
          and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% 
          of people with diabetes have type 2.
          3) Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who 
          have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, 
          your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. 
          Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is 
          born. However, it increases your risk for type 2 diabetes 
          later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a 
          child or teen and develop type 2 diabetes later in life."

  utter_gestational:
  - text: "Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who

          your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. 
          Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is

          later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a 
          child or teen and develop type 2 diabetes later in life."

  utter_symptoms:
  - text: "Diabetes symptoms include: being very thirsty, urinating 
          often, feeling very hungry, feeling very tired, losing weight 
          without trying, sores that heal slowly, dry & itchy skin, 
          feelings of pins and needles in your feet, losing feeling in 
          your feet, blurry eyesight, hyperglycemia (high blood 
          sugar), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

          Note: Some people with diabetes don't have any of these 
          signs or symptoms. The only way to know if you have 
          diabetes is to have your doctor do a blood test."

  utter_causes:
  - text: "The cause of diabetes, regardless of the type, is having too 
          much glucose circulating in your bloodstream. However, 
          the reason why your blood glucose levels are high differs 
          depending on the type of diabetes.

          1) Causes of Type 1 diabetes: This is an immune system 
          disease. Your body attacks and destroys insulin-producing 
          cells in your pancreas. Without insulin to allow glucose to 
          enter your cells, glucose builds up in your bloodstream. 
          Genes may also play a role in some patients. Also, a virus 
          may trigger the immune system attack.

          2) Causes of Type 2 diabetes: Your body's cells don't 
          allow insulin to work as it should to let glucose into its 
          cells. Your body's cells have become resistant to insulin. 
          Your pancreas can't keep up and make enough insulin to 
          overcome this resistance. Glucose levels rise in your 
          bloodstream.

          3) Causes gestational diabetes: Hormones produced by the 
          placenta during your pregnancy make your body's cells 
          more resistant to insulin. Your pancreas can't make enough 
          insulin to overcome this resistance. Too much glucose 
          remains in your bloodstream."

  utter_cure:
  - text: "No, diabetes cannot be cured but it can only be controlled.
          This is a disorder either due to defective action or 
          deficiency of insulin. So when the blood sugar is kept 
          under control, a diabetic can have a healthy, normal life."

  utter_prevention:
  - text: "Although diabetes risk factors like family history and race 
          can't be changed, there are other risk factors that you can 
          manage, to an extent. Adopting some of the healthy 
          lifestyle habits listed below can improve these modifiable 
          risk factors and help to decrease your chances of getting 
          diabetes:
          1) Eat a healthy diet. Keep a food diary and calorie count 
          of everything you eat. Cutting 250 calories per day can 
          help you lose Â½ pound per week.
          2) Be physically active. Aim for 30 minutes a day at least 
          five days a week. Start slow and work up to this amount or 
          break up these minutes into more doable 10-minute 
          segments. Walking is great exercise.
          3) Work to achieve a weight that's healthy for you. 
          4) Lower your stress. Learn relaxation techniques, deep 
          breathing exercises, mindful meditation, yoga and other 
          helpful strategies.
          5) Limit alcohol intake. Men should drink no more than 
          two beverages containing alcohol a day; women should 
          drink no more than one.
          6) Get an adequate amount of sleep (typically 7 to 9 hours).
          7) Quit smoking.
          8) Take medications as directed by your healthcare 
          provider to manage existing risk factors for heart disease 
          (like high blood pressure, cholesterol) or to reduce the risk 
          of developing Type 2 diabetes."

  utter_deadly:
  - text: "Yes, it's possible that if diabetes remains undiagnosed and 
          unmanaged (severely high or severely low glucose levels) 
          it can cause devastating harm to your body. Diabetes can 
          cause heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure and 
          coma. These complications can lead to your death. 
          Cardiovascular disease in particular is the leading cause of 
          death in adults with diabetes."

  utter_treatment:
  - text: "Treatments for diabetes depend on your type of diabetes, 
          how well managed your blood glucose level is and your 
          other existing health conditions.
          
          1) Type 1 diabetes: If you have this type, you must take 
          insulin every day. Your pancreas no longer makes insulin.
          
          2) Type 2 diabetes: If you have this type, your treatments 
          can include medications (both for diabetes and for 
          conditions that are risk factors for diabetes), insulin and 
          lifestyle changes such as losing weight, making healthy 
          food choices and being more physically active.
          
          3) Gestational diabetes: If you have this type and your 
          glucose level is not too high, your initial treatment might 
          be modifying your diet and getting regular exercise. If the 
          target goal is still not met or your glucose level is very 
          high, your healthcare team may start medication or insulin."

  utter_almond:
  - text: "Almonds contain good fats that lower insulin resistance. 
          It is by reducing inflammation in your body's tissues. 
          These are including those in your brain cells which regulate the metabolism of sugars. 
          Eating almonds regularly would help control glucose levels."

  utter_aloevera:
  - text: "Aloe vera has been used for decades as a natural remedy to treat diabetes. 
          It contains enzymes that regulate blood sugar levels. It also has anti-inflammatory properties. 
          These can help with insulin resistance."

  utter_chillipeppers:
  - text: "These peppers are known to be high in antioxidants and capsaicin. This can help regulate blood sugar levels. 
          They also have thermogenic effects that boost metabolism."

  utter_orange:
  - text: "Oranges are loaded with vitamin C, fiber, and essential minerals like thiamin that can help to control diabetes. 
          Oranges are low in the glycemic index; therefore, it makes the glucose slowly release into the blood. 
          Moreover, eating oranges can help to control weight gain."

  utter_bittergaurd:
  - text: "Bitter gourd has a compound that is beneficial in lowering 
           the blood sugar levels. It is loaded with fiber and also 
           possesses charantin, an antidiabetic compound which 
           exhibits blood-glucose lowering agents."

  utter_ladyfinger:
  - text: "Lady's finger is one of the best home remedies for 
          diabetes. It contains a high amount of vitamin A, C, K and 
          B6, potassium, magnesium, zinc and other soluble fiber 
          that makes it as a great blood sugar stabilizer and thereby 
          treats diabetes."

  utter_jamun:
  - text: "Jamun is high in vitamin C, iron, calcium, and phosphorus 
          which help to speed up the immune system. Its seeds are 
          used to treat diabetes effectively while its leaves and the 
          extracts of bark are effective in lowering the levels of 
          blood sugar and sugar or glycosuria in the urine."

  utter_tulsi:
  - text: "Tulsi contains multiple health beneficial properties such as 
          antibacterial, anti-stress, antiviral, antifungal, antidiabetic, 
          antiasthmatic, antioxidant, antitumor, gastric antiulcer, 
          immune-stimulant, and antimutagenic. Its leaves are very 
          useful in reducing your blood glucose levels."
