  utter_intro:
  - text: "Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused 
          by the varicella zoster virus. The virus usually 
          infects children, however adults who were not 
          infected as children can also become infected if 
          exposed to the virus."

  utter_causes:
  - text: "Chickenpox is a disease caused by the varicella zoster virus."

  utter_spreadable:
  - text: "Chickenpox is highly contagious. It spreads from 
          person to person by direct contact or through the 
          air by coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread 
          through direct contact with the fluid from a blister 
          of a person infected with chickenpox, or from 
          direct contact with a sore from a person with 
          shingles."

  utter_infect:
  - text: "If you get chickenpox, let your doctor know right 
          away. Two shots of the vaccine and prescribed 
          medication will be enough to treat it. Besides, 
          you can also take some home remedies."

  utter_symptoms:
  - text: "The most common symptoms of chickenpox are:
          rash, fever, coughing, fussiness, headache, and 
          loss of appetite. The rash usually develops on the 
          scalp and body, and then spreads to the face, 
          arms, and legs. The illness lasts about 5 to 10 days."

  utter_shingles:
  - text: "Both chickenpox and shingles are caused by the 
          same virus. After a person has had chickenpox, 
          the virus remains in the body permanently, but 
          silently. About one-third of all people who have 
          been infected with chickenpox later develop the 
          disease known as shingles (herpes zoster). 
          Symptoms of shingles are pain, itching, blisters, 
          and loss of feeling along a nerve. Most cases 
          occur in people older than 50, and the risk of 
          developing shingles increases with age."

  utter_prevent:
  - text: "Yes, chickenpox is preventable. The best way to 
          prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox 
          vaccine. Everyone—children, adolescents, and 
          adults—should get two doses of chickenpox 
          vaccine if they have never had chickenpox or 
          were never vaccinated."

  utter_vaccine_effects:
  - text: "The chickenpox vaccine, like any other 
          medication is not without associated side-effects. 
          Any that are to be expected, are relatively mild 
          though. Once you receive the vaccine you may 
          experience temporary inflammation (redness) and 
          swelling at the injection site, and a little pain. 
          Some may even develop a little bit of a mild rash
          or low-grade fever. All side effects typically clear 
          in a short period of time."

  utter_likelihood:
  - text: "Anyone who has never had the disease or has not 
          received the chickenpox vaccine can get 
          chickenpox. Chickenpox is commonly diagnosed 
          in young children, although teens and adults can 
          get the disease also. Chickenpox can occur in 
          vaccinated persons. These persons usually have 
          mild symptoms for a shorter amount of time, with 
          fewer than 50 blisters, and low or no fever."

  utter_home_remedies:
  - text: "Home remedies for chickenpox include: aloe 
          vera, neem, lemon juice, herbal tea, honey, 
          ginger, baking soda, calamine lotion, and cold 
          compress."

  utter_aloevera:
  - text: "Aloe vera gel soothes and cools inflamed and 
          itchy skin during chickenpox. It moisturizes the 
          skin, has anti-inflammatory properties, and helps 
          reduce the itching."

  utter_neem:
  - text: "The neem tree is loaded with antiviral and 
          antibacterial properties. It gives instant itch relief. 
          This potent ointment also dries the blisters, 
          thereby accelerating the healing process."

  utter_lemon:
  - text: "Lime juice contains vitamin C and antioxidants 
          that speed up the healing process of the chickenpox scars and rashes."

  utter_herbal_tea:
  - text: "Herbal teas like chamomile, basil, and lemon 
          have a multitude of medicinal properties. They 
          regulate the gastrointestinal system and boost 
          immunity. Their anti-inflammatory compounds 
          and antioxidants aid quick recovery from 
          chickenpox."

  utter_honey:
  - text: "Applying honey is a natural humectant and the 
          best remedy for those itchy sores and lesions. It 
          will not only reduce the urge to scratch but also 
          help to reduce scarring."

  utter_ginger:
  - text: "Ginger has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial 
          properties. The chickenpox scabs and rashes will 
          start healing, and the itching will greatly reduce 
          with this remedy. Just take 2-3 tablespoons ginger 
          powder and add this to your bath water and soak 
          in it for 20 minutes."

  utter_soda:
  - text: "Baking soda soothes the itchy and inflamed 
          rashes on your skin. It is also antimicrobial in 
          nature and helps in faster recovery from the 
          infection. Alternatively, you can also add an 
          antiseptic liquid like Dettol or Savlon to the bath 
          and soak in it for a couple of minutes."

  utter_calamine:
  - text: "Calamine lotion is a mixture of zinc oxide and 
          calamine. Gently applying it to the sores on the 
          skin may help soothe itching."

  utter_cold_compress:
  - text: "Cold compresses can be very effective. Just wrap 
          an ice pack in a towel and gently apply it to itchy 
          skin soothe the itch."
