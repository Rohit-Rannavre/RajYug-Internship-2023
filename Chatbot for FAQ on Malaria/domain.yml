responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! I am here to help you with malaria. What do you wish to know?"

  utter_again:
  - text: "Want to know more about malaria?"

  utter_continue:
  - text: "what else do you want to know?"

  utter_intro:
  - text: "Malaria is a disease caused by 'Plasomodium' parasites 
          that are transmitted from person to person via female 
          mosquitoes of Anopheles."

  utter_infection:
  - text: "When an Anopheles mosquito bites an infected person, a 
          small amount of blood is taken which contains malaria 
          parasites. These parasites multiply inside the mosquito 
          and are then transmitted to another person when the 
          mosquito bites. Once bitten, the parasites multiply in the 
          liver, and then infect red blood cells (RBCs). Since 
          plasmodium is a parasite of human blood, it can be 
          transmitted through blood transfusion, organ transplant, or 
          the shared use of needles or syringes. Malaria can also be 
          transmitted from a woman to her unborn baby before or 
          during delivery."
  
  utter_symptoms:
  - text: "The most common symptoms or malaria are: fever, 
          headache, shivering, nausea and vomiting. Malaria may 
          also cause anaemia and jaundice because of the loss of 
          RBCs. Symptoms in sever forms of the disease include 
          very high fever, severe headache, kidney failure, impaired 
          consciousness and coma."

  utter_cure:
  - text: "Yes, malaria is curable if proper and timely treatment is sought."

  utter_prevention:
  - text: "If you live in an area where malaria is a problem, you and 
          your family can prevent malaria by: 
          1) keeping mosquitoes from biting you, especially by wearing insect repellent and 
          long-sleeved clothing if out of doors at night. 
          2) eliminating places around your home where mosquitoes breed. 
          3) spraying insecticides on your walls to kill adult mosquitoes that come inside. 
          4) sleeping under bednets."

  utter_mosquito_id:
  - text: "It is difficult for the untrained eye to recognize 
          Anopheles mosquitoes, especially as they usually bite 
          at night."

  utter_occurance:
  - text: "In 2013, malaria transmission was ongoing in 97 
          countries and territories, mainly in Africa, Europe and 
          the Middle East. It usually occurs in tropical and 
          subtropical countries where the physical environment 
          and warm temperatures favor the breeding of Anopheles mosquitoes."

  utter_medicine:
  - text: "Yes there are, but the ideal medicine will depend on 
          factors like the type of malaria parasites active in a 
          given area and drug resistance. You should consult a 
          doctor to determine the recommended medicine to be 
          used."

          ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, tulsi, neem, coconut water 
          that you can use to relieve malaria symptoms and 
          recover quickly. However, do not use these herbs as an 
          alternative to standard medical treatment. Instead, talk 
          to your healthcare provider before you try out any 
          home remedy for malaria."

  utter_ginger:

          symptoms like nausea and vomiting. Several clinical

          turmeric, has shown antimalarial activity against 
          malaria-causing pathogens according to animal studies. 
          Therefore, turmeric may help those suffering from 
          malaria recover fast. There are many ways to use
